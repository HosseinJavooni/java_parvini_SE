subjects:
1- constructors
2- Initialization blocks
3- Packages in java

Points:
1.constructor definition:
constructor is a block code with the same name by its class that is not a method
 because it has no return type! who run after object creations.
2.A final variable gets a value once and never changes. so the final variable can get a value
      in the constructor or initialization block but not in methods because methods can be called
      more than one time in the execution process.
3.Initialization blocks run before constructors!
4.We have three syntax of 'this' in java:
    this   --> this.i = i
    this()  --> constructor overloading
    ClassName.this -->

subject of session_09:
1-Modifiers: modifiers are some word that modify status of  methods or fields or initialization block or etc.


points
1- in java we have:
    No static class (outer class)
    No static constructor
    No static local variable
    but
    static fields
    static methods
    static code block
2- we can't override static methods in java because they are early binding ,so they refer to specific implementation always
3- Utility Class: a class that all methods are static.
